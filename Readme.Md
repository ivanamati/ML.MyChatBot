This is my first ML or AI chatbot.

I did it with the help of youtube tutorial and trained it with the json file about me.

This Chatbot was builed to learn something about NLP, ML learning and the way that my model learns about language. 
According to principles of NLP this approach is text classification using the bag of words and "tags".
